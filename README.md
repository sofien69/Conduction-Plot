Conduction in Cells - Python Simulation

Overview

This project aims to study the conduction of electrical signals in biological cells using Python. The simulation models the propagation of electrical impulses based on biophysical principles, such as ion channel activity and membrane potential changes.

Features

Simulates the conduction of electrical signals in a cell.

Implements numerical methods for solving differential equations.

Models ion channel behavior and membrane potential variations.

Visualizes the results using plots and graphs.

Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

Python 3.x

NumPy

SciPy

Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

Usage

Run the simulation using:

python simulation.py

The program will compute and display the conduction behavior over time.

Methodology

The simulation uses:

The Hodgkin-Huxley model to describe action potential propagation.

Finite difference methods for numerical integration.

Graphical analysis to visualize conduction properties.

Results

The output consists of:

Membrane potential plots over time.

Current and conductance variations.

Phase-space representations of conduction dynamics.

Future Work
